# Pacman-in-C
Pacman game made in C language, a few years ago

There are the codes of the two versions made by me:
-- The early first CMD version called "pacman.c". You just need to compile it on linux's command line by typing: gcc pacman.c -o pacman
-- The second with graphical interface that contains "main.c" and a folder called "BIBLIOTECAS" that contains the functions used in "main.c"(they're all downloadable here in github). It requires ALLEGRO library to be installed - see more at http://liballeg.org/


NOTE: the game won't work without the folder "IMG" that holds the images of the game's sprites. I'll try to host it later. If you want to see, I can send you the runable version, so please just send me an email:
