# Pacman-in-C
Pacman game made in C language, a few years ago

There are the codes of the two versions made by me:

-- The early first CMD version called "pacman.c". You just need to compile it on linux's command line by typing: gcc pacman.c -o pacman

-- The second one with graphical interface that contains "main.c" and a folder called "BIBLIOTECAS" that holds the functions used in "main.c"(they're all downloadable here in github). It requires ALLEGRO library to be installed - see more at http://liballeg.org/


NOTE: the game won't work without the folder "IMG" that holds the images of the game's sprites. If you had problems to compile and want the compiled game, I can send you the runnable version, so please just send me an email:
